      "This tutorial was inspired by Tanya Hill's excellent talk at the 2014 IPS conference in Beijing. In it she presented a number of surveys (including the Galaxy And Mass Assembly survey, GAMA) and described the process of importing them into SkySkan's Digital Sky software. The wealth and variety of available data was both impressive and eye-opening to a planetarium community that largely limits itself to showing three galaxy catalogs (the so-called \"Tully\" catalog along with the 2dF and SDSS, and most often an out of date version of the latter). At the close of the question period IPS president Thomas Kraupe declared that he would like to see these datasets made available in all planetarium systems.\n",

      "In this tutorial we'll step through the entire process, pulling the data fom the survey database, performing astrophysical calculations and outputing the data in the formats necessary to visualize it in four different planetarium software packages. I encourage everyone to at read through the entire tutorial, even the parts that apply to software packages different than the one you are running at your institution, doing so will give you a more complete picture of where the community is and help motivate the final section where we make recomendations on how the process can be made improved.

A survey database typically contains several different tables each measuring a number of different quantities. Looking at the structure of the GAMA database (its schema) I see that the quantities I need to locate the galaxies in 3D space can be found in a table called specObj. These are sky position (RA and dec) and the redshift(z) which we will use to calculate the distance to the galaxy. There is another table called StellarMasses which has several interesting parameters, we will get three that might be useful to visualize later. There are the mass of the galaxy (logmstar), its instrinsic brightness (absMag_r) and its metalicity (metal).\n",

      "To plot the galaxies in 3D space we need both the position on the sky and a distance. We will convert the redshift into a distance, but how? On cosmological scales in an expanding universe with a finite speed of light, there are several ways to measure distance. Which one should we use? People have made different choices here. Some use the lookback time distance, which is the light travel time from the galaxy multiplied by the speed of light. Others have used the luminosity distance which is the distance at which the galaxy would have its observed brightness given the inverse square law. I believe that the best choice is the co-moving distance. This distance is the one that best matches our expectation of what distance is. If we were able to stop the expansion of the universe and go and measure the distance to galaxies that is what we would get.\n",

Dear IMMERSA participants,

I hope you will be able to able to join us for the “Data to Dome” workshop on Wednesday at 2PM. The goal of the workshop is to promote a “modern” way of working with astronomical data that will make us more efficient, make it easier to collaborate and expand the content available in our domes.

We will be using iPython notebooks. A great description of this platform was written up recently in Nature: http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261

Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop, but if one isn’t available come anyway and make a new friend or find an old one and partner up with someone else. If possible bring a copy of your planetarium’s software package, if you can’t I suggest installing Worldwide Telescope.

No programming experience is necessary we will be providing templates for you to step through and modify.

To get started you’ll need to setup python/iPython and some additional packages on your computer.
Here is an easy way to do that:

First Install the (free) Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/ (this includes python, iPython notebooks and most of mathematical/scientific packages needed) 
Next we need to install some additional packages that are used in the tutorials, we will do that from the command line.
Open a terminal and install the packages with the following commands:
pip install astroquery
pip install pyWWT
conda install seaborn

Great you are ready to go! To start the notebook type “ipython notebook” on the command line.
Now you are ready to load the notebooks for that we will be using for the tutorials, you can get them here:

I also have some platform dependent ones here:

If you have any questions or problems with the above instructions please feel free to email me.
